  - interactive diagram editing
    - undo fuction
    - keyboard shortcuts
    - coordinates updating persistently
    - context menu on right click (default actions)
      - Class diagram (on class):
        - modify - shows class definition in text editor

        - add relation (+ type of relation) - adds relation between classes in interactive mode
      - Sequence diagram (column):
        - modify    - shows sequence diagram in text editor
        - view clas - shows class definition in text editor
